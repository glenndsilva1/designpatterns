You can apply the Command Pattern when multiple receivers (like Fan and Light) perform the same set of actions (like turning on or off).
Instead of writing separate methods in each receiver 
class to handle these actions, you can define commands that represent these actions. 
These command objects can then be executed on any receiver.

For example, consider a system where you have different devices (like Fan and Light) and you want to control them using a remote. 
Each device can be turned on or off, which are common actions. The Command Pattern allows you to define these actions (like TurnOn, TurnOff) 
in command objects and then apply them to different receivers (the Fan or the Light).
